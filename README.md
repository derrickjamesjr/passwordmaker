# <ins>A Password Maker for Anyone to Use</ins>

<p>Hello sir or ma'am, the website that i have posted for you to ise should be able to generate random passwords from 8 to 128 characters in length with options for any possible combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters.</p>

# Description

I, first, started by creating prompts asking how many as well as a which character types(Uppercas, lowercase, numerical, special) they would like included in their password. Once created, I then, with help from my TAs, determined that they needed to be placed into an initial array towards the process to be arranged into the password box. After the initial array is collected, the step would be to randomly sort the initial array to make it easier to grab a sequence of characters from the array. I then tried to make it display a random substring multiple times to which it would always error due it not being functional. After a little reserach, I stumbled across the slice function which happened to work as well as a substring. So i chose to use that. The slice of the inital array would then cut the number of characters equal to the number they chose as the length of the password that will then display into the password box. It was very challenging and i gave myself a lot to do, but i can imagine this came out as a good product and i hope it works for you as well as it did for me.
